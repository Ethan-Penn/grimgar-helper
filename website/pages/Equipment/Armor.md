# Armor
|Armor	|Cost	|Bonus	|Max Magic	|Weight	|Properties
|Cloth	|20 cp	|+1		|---		|Light	|
|Padded	|2 sp	|+2		|---		|Light	|
The Max Magic field of armor restricts your Magic defense bonus from your spellcasting ability. i.e. a spellcasting ability of 3 (such as 3 CHA) would normally result in 5 Magic armor. With Light or Average armor, this would not change, but with Heavy armor, it would restrict the +3 from the spellcasting ability to +2 resulting in 4 Magic armor. As mentioned above, a shield would reduce this even further to +1 for a total of 3 Magic armor.
